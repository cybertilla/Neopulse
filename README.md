# Neopulse
 Arduido project with neopixel led stripes and a pulse sensor

This code allows two LEDs to blink according to the users' heartbeat.

Required material:
-pulse sensor
-neopixel LED stripe

I used a redboard by SparkFun but this can easily work with any other Arduino-like board.
Adjust pin out if needed.
Not adressing all the LEDs ensures the board's wellbeing in early stages
(if you are still trying to figure out the cabling to support all LEDs for instance).
This allows for testing and adjusting the hearbeat sensor's threshold.
